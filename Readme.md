# Open Source University Courses Repository

## Project Title
Open Source University Courses Repository

## Project Description
The **Open Source University Courses Repository** is a decentralized platform powered by blockchain technology. It allows users to create, share, and manage university-level courses securely. The smart contract enables instructors to publish courses, students to enroll, and track their course progress in a transparent, immutable way. All data is stored on the blockchain to ensure authenticity, and any course can be accessed and contributed to by anyone in the community.

## Contract Address
0x70998c72BE759e4793930e7a813fC995ef158186

## Project Vision
The vision of the Open Source University Courses Repository is to create a global, decentralized educational ecosystem where everyone, regardless of location, can access high-quality university-level courses. By using blockchain technology, the project ensures transparency, accountability, and security in the creation and management of courses. We aim to foster an open, collaborative, and inclusive educational environment that is not restricted by geographical or institutional barriers.

## Key Features
1. **Decentralized Course Creation**: Anyone can create a new course by interacting with the smart contract, allowing educators to share knowledge freely.
2. **Transparent Enrollment**: Students can view available courses and enroll in them directly on the blockchain. Enrollments are immutable and transparent.
3. **Immutability**: All course data (e.g., title, description, student enrollments) is stored on the blockchain, preventing tampering or alteration.
4. **Course Completion Tracking**: Students can mark their completion of a course, and this information is securely recorded on the blockchain.
5. **Open-Source and Community-Driven**: The entire system is open-source, enabling anyone to contribute, improve, or fork the project.
6. **Access to Course Information**: Users can easily access course details, including enrolled students, and track their own enrolled courses through simple functions.

## How to Use the Contract

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contract
- Deploy this contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).
- Use Remix IDE, Hardhat, or Truffle to deploy the contract to the network.
- After deployment, note the contract address and interact with the contract using a Web3 wallet like MetaMask.

### 2. Creating a Course
To create a course, use the `createCourse` function with the course title and description.

Example:
```solidity
createCourse("Blockchain 101", "A beginner's guide to blockchain technology.");
```

### 3. Enrolling in a Course
To enroll in a course, call the `enrollInCourse` function with the course ID.

Example:
```solidity
enrollInCourse(1);
```

### 4. Completing a Course
Once you've finished the course content, call the `completeCourse` function to mark the course as complete.

Example:
```solidity
completeCourse(1);
```

### 5. Retrieving Course Information
You can retrieve the details of any course, including its enrolled students, using the `getCourse` function.

Example:
```solidity
getCourse(1);
```

You can also see all the courses you are enrolled in by calling the `getStudentCourses` function.

Example:
```solidity
getStudentCourses(msg.sender);
```
